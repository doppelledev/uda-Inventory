## Functionality
You can add items to your inventory, specify a name, price, quantity and an optional description.</br>
After entering the information, you can save the item, and the data will be stored in a database.</br>
The catalog view is a list view of all the items in the database.</br>
Clicking on a list item opens up a detail view which contains detailed information about the item, and an order button.</br>
Clicking on the order button opens up Amazon website in the navigator, and searches the website for the name of the item.</br>
The detail view also contains a menu item which allows editing the item.
